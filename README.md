# Factors Affecting Global Warming


### Motivation
Over the past 50 years, the average global temperature has increased at the fastest rate in recorded history. And experts see the trend is accelerating: All but one of the 16 hottest years in NASA’s 134-year record have occurred since 2000.
Global warming occurs when carbon dioxide (CO2) and other air pollutants and greenhouse gases collect in the atmosphere and absorb sunlight and solar radiation that have bounced off the earth’s surface. Normally, this radiation would escape into space—but these pollutants, which can last for years to centuries in the atmosphere, trap the heat and cause the planet to get hotter. That's what's known as the greenhouse effect.

In the United States, the burning of fossil fuels to make electricity is the largest source of heat-trapping pollution, producing about two billion tons of CO2 every year. Coal-burning power plants are by far the biggest polluters. The country’s second-largest source of carbon pollution is the transportation sector, which generates about 1.7 billion tons of CO2 emissions a year.

In this project we studied and correlated how various factors such as C02 emission, urbanization and depleting forest cover across top 5 most populas countries have impacted the change in temperature in these 5 countries.

### Libraries Used
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - matplotlib

To install the above packages using pip, use command
```$pip install package-name```

### Files Description
- main.ipynb: The jupyter notebook which includes the analysis
<<<<<<< HEAD
- GetCountryList.py gets the list of 6 most populated countries
- TemperatureData.py extracts the temperature data from 1960 to 2013 for the above 5 countries and considers relative temperature change for each country from 1960 to 2013.
- CreateDictOfDataFrames.py returns a dictionary of dataframes (of all the factors taken into consideration)

### Usage
  - Run the jupyter notebook main.ipynb
